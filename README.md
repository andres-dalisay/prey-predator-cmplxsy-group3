# prey-predator-netlogo
This project aims to model a predator-prey ecosystem involving sharks, fishes, and planktons. The shark and fish agents both have the ablity to move, gain energy by eating, lose energy by moving, and have the probability to generate a number of offsprings. Moreover, the fishes are able to from schools of fish. The planktons implemented in this project are in forms of green patches that regenerate every given number of ticks. 

This project uses the Wolf Sheep Predation and Flocking models found in NetLogo's model libraries as a reference.
